# Employee Tracker

A MySQL-based command line application for working with and exploring your company's records.

## How to Install
*Note: To use this application, you must have both Node.js and MySQL installed.*

Download the files in this repository, or clone it to your machine. Using your preferred terminal, navigate to the directory it is in and run `npm i` to install all the necessary packages. After this, use the `source` command in MySQL to run the *schema.sql* file in the db/ folder. This will generate the default database and tables.

## How to Use

Run `npm start` in the project directory to start the app. Follow the prompts on screen.
